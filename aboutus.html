            <h2>About us.</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Acadamic Transcript, your go-to platform for tracking marks and managing academic portfolios</p>
            <p>We are a group of dedicated students from EDUMOON Industry Ready Programme who have come together to create a tool that simplifies the process of monitoring academic performance. Our motivation stemmed from the need to have an organized and efficient way to track grades and maintain portfolios, which can be a daunting task for students.</p>
            <p>Our vision is to continuously improve this platform to better serve students. We plan to integrate additional features such as interactive dashboards, collaboration tools, and more.</p>
            <p>For any questions, feedback, or support, feel free to contact us at academictranscript@gmail.com </p>
